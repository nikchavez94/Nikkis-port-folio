# Nikkis-port-folio Project 
## Portfolio Project
I started out the project by first creating the HTML, follow by the CSS, and added the last Javascirpt command. The first goal was the create a heading with clickable buttons that would lead the user to each section. Then I was able to link those buttons to the sections and added the written content using <p> tags. Later the container that help the flex box features was added to create the ability for the webpage to change size with the window. The CSS was added and adjusted many times until a unique style was achieved. The javascript was the hardest part to do and it was done by creating a function that linked to the buttons and asked the function to scroll down the page upon clicking! 

## Contributions
The bootcamp classes acted as contributions to this project. Without the courses I would have been completely lost. W3 Schools was also used as a reference to differentiate between different tags. Youtube was also consulted.
