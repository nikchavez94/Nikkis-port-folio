        <p>The image below shows a preview of my first project completed during the bootcamp.
             Please click on the image to access the finished project.</p>

        <p> The project was based on making sure that the functioning code was understandable, and
             functional with CSS. By this I mean that some elements may have needed to be moved
            to make more fluidity with the elements in the HTML. It was also required to add commenting
        to each section of code to ensure understanding.  </p>

            <h1>FirstLookMovie Website Project</h1>
            <p>Click on the image below to launch the deployed website. The webpage contains all the base codes of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The HTML was created to have a clean, straight-forward appeal. The user enters the webpage to see a search box where they can enter a movie title. The data that is being pulled is coming from two separate APIs, REDDIT and OMDB. When the search button is clicked, the data will be displayed on the screen. To call that data, you will notice that the Javascript code contains two fetch functions that request the json information from those two websites. After those requests are made, an additional function was created for each request that will allow the information to be applied to two separate divs that are connected to the HTML. The information will be displayed in the respective sections, Reddit and OMDB, which will be loaded on the page. Users will then have the opportunity to read the information pulled, or they may enter a new movie title which will start that same series of events over again. </p>
